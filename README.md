# Description

This is a template project. It implements a minimal React frontend with Redux, express backend, postgresql database interface, OAuth authentication, and Jest/ TestingLibrary / Supertest testing. It may be over-engineered for your needs; see `https://github.com/michael-chiang-dev5/template-rama` for a template containing
only a react frontend and express backend.

## Setup

- Rename `SECRETS_EXAMPLE.js` to `secrets.js` and fill in information. Email michael.chiang.dev5@gmail.com if you have any questions.
- Start the frontend with `npm run frontend`
- Start the backend with `npm run backend`
- Open `localhost:3000` in the browser
- You will need to create a "Users" table to store authentication info. See `src/db/Tutorial.md` for instructions on how to set up the auth table.
