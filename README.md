# Description

This is a template project. It implements a minimal React frontend with Redux, express backend, postgresql database interface, and OAuth authentication.

- Rename `SECRETS_EXAMPLE.js` to `secrets.js` and fill in information. Email michael.chiang.dev5@gmail.com if you have any questions.
- Start the frontend with `npm run frontend`
- Start the backend with `npm run backend`
- You will need to create a "Users" table to store authentication info. See `src/db/Tutorial.md` for instructions on how to set up the auth table.

# Notes on design decisions

## Wrapping app in a creator function

Note that app, passport are created dynamically with creator functions rather than the usual way of directly instantiating an express app / passport. The reason for this is increased modularity; dynamic creation of app gives us the ability to plug in different databases.

Note that most express tutorials create a single server.js file that creates the server. I create the server dynamically using appCreator and set the listener, database in server.js. This has the advantage of increased modularity; you can initialize servers with different database which is useful for testing.

## Supertest

There are two possible strategies to test the backend.

1. Initialize and teardown the server prior to running tests, listening to port 8081. Run all tests on the same server instance.
2. Initialize a different server for each test. These servers are passed directly to supertest's `request` and do not listen to any ports.

I have implemented (2) because it allows for greater modularity of tests. If tests affect the state of the server, then testing order could affect test outcomes.

## Tests on the database

Running unit tests on the database presents several challenges:

1. Database tests should be performed on a disposable test database rather than a production (or even dev) database.

2. Tests are run asynchronously, so different tests should run on different databases in order to prevent collisions.

# Miscellaneous

- The extend-expect module is a part of @testing-library/jest-dom that extends `expect` with custom matchers automatically so you don't have to import them separately.

## mocking static assets

## .env and secrets.js

You can store environment variables in either `.env` or `secrets.js`. Each method comes with advantages and disadvantages:

The advantage of .env is:

- You can specify .env variables when running bash scripts. This because important during testing, when we want to switch from `MODE=dev` to `MODE=test` on the fly without editing secrets.js

The advantage of `secrets.js` is:

- You can do logic such as concatenating a password to a URI.
- You can declar non-string variables (bools, functions, etc.)

When using .env, to access `process.env` you will need the following:
`require('dotenv').config();`

## Babel

For more information on babel setup: https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup/

Babel is required to enable uncoming javascript features in node (such as import), as well as browser transpilation (typescript, etc.)

Babel configuration is done within ".babelrc" instead of package.json because this is considered best practice (reasons below):

- .babelrc is specific to babel and reduces clutter in package.json. Imagine doing webpack, ESLint, Babel configuration all within package.json and how difficult it would be to read.
- .babel is more modular and makes it easier to share Babel configurations

## Webpack

I decided on webpack over vite. Why?

# TODO

- add in dotenv with test, dev (prod later)
- Add in testing
  - Talk about mocha vs jest for mongoose
  - use mocks for db
- proxy to 8080
